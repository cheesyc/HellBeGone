# HellBeGone

**Install**
Download the .crx file somewhere safe. Now, go to chrome://extensions/. Drag the CRX onto the window. It should say "Drop To Install".
Do that. Click "Add Extension" and boom! HellBeGone is insstalled.

**Miscellaneous Notes*
I might upload it to the Chrome Extension Store someday. I haven't decided yet. This took me, like, 5 minutes so it's not a big deal
